# Course Overview

Very basic concepts making you acquire new knowledge every week.

Below is an overview of the course, from the first to the last week, to guide you.

# Week 1 - Course Introduction and Introduction

Notion of what the course will be and we will present an overview of the area of ​​Computer Science and the Python language.
Introduction to the Python programming language and variables.

## Contents:

* Introduction

What is Computer Science? (Knowledge involved, basic and advanced skills, basics and "Where to start?")

* Introduction to Python

How to install and open the Python interpreter, some arithmetic operators (**, *, /, ...) and relational operators (==, !=, >, >=, ...)

* Variables and First Program

IDLE environment website and download, variables (definition, naming, assignment), "print" command, first program (creation and execution)

## Reference

As here, this course has a textbook that you should read to consolidate your learning and that also serves as a reference. This week's reading is also introductory:

# Week 3 – Conditional – if..else

* Conditional branches that you can implement in programs, using the command "if..else".
* Variables and Boolean expressions.

## Contents:

* Boolean expressions

"bool" data type, logical operators (and, or, not), and precedence between relational, logical, and arithmetic operators

Note: some exercises in these pages of the textbook need repetition with while for resolution. However, this content is only seen Week4.

# Week 4 - Repetition - while

* Program the repeated execution of the same set of instructions through loops.
* Pass indicators and use the debugger that monitors the execution of the program, helping to understand and detect possible errors.

## Contents:

* Repetition – while

Definition and explanation of the while command, 3 examples and a challenge

* Boolean Variables - Passage Indicators

Passage Indicators, 2 examples and 1 challenge

* Debugger (Debugger)

How to use the debugger in its simplest form

# Week 5 - Functions

* Use functions.
* Introduction to pytest for performing automated code tests.

Contents:

* Functions

Definition, creation and use of functions. Variable scope.

* Task Resolution and Tests

Types of errors (syntax and logic). Role naming. Test definition. Creating and running a test function.

* Automated Tests – Introduction to pytest

Definition and why create automated test. How to test them. Installation and explanation of how pytest works. Usage example.

## Contents:

* Debugger

Functioning in context where there are multiple functions.

* Exercise Solved - Bhaskara's Formula

Code refactoring and problem decomposition

# Week 7 – Embedded Repeats

Loops of loops, technique called nested repetitions or nested loops.

## Contents:

* Embedded Repeats or Nested Loops
